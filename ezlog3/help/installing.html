                        <h1>Installing EzLog4J</h1> 
                        <p>Once Java has been installed on your computer, EzLog4J was made to run from a simple click. If your operating system complains when you click on the 
<b>dist/ezlog3.jar</b> file, then Microsoft Windows can click-on the provided <b>ezlog.bat</b> batch-file from within The Microsoft Windows File Manager. 
In a like manner, Linux users can click to try the virtues of the included <b>ezlog.sh</b> file.</p>
                        <P>Yet, bad things can *still* sometimes happen to good people... Especially on Microsoft Windows. 
                            Hence, if you see errors such as:</P>
                        <p><font size='7'>&quot;</font><img src="JnlpLoaderSad.png" alt="jnlp errors"><font size='7'>&quot;</font></p>
                        <P>Not to worry. All is still well! --Some folks might need to (3) right-click on the
                            ezlog3.jar, then select the &quot;<I><B>Run with Java</B></I>&quot;
                            (sic) option from their file manager. Others might need (2)
                            administrator rights to run ezlog3.jar for the <I><B>first</B></I>
                            time. Still others might like to (1) use &quot;<I><B>java -jar
                                    ezlog3.jar</B></I>&quot; to start the program from where ezlog was installed in a
                            command-line / DOS / terminal session.</p> 
                        
                        <P>After trying all of the above, if you still have trouble then feel free to <a href='http://soft9000.com/blog9000/contact.php'>contact me</a> if you need help.
