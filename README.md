# EzLog4J
My classic plain-text logger - as used by Skype - now with a GUI to manage the log-file.


## HISTORY: ezlog3


From charge-codes to inspiration, I wrote EzLog to 
help me keep track of things happening during the 
day. Note that in addition to being a stand-alone 
logger in its own right, EzLog4J also offers us a 
graphical way to manage .ezlog files.

Perfect for console log monitoring, whenever a user 
or other program changes any open .ezlog file, the 
GUI will prompt us to refresh our view.
